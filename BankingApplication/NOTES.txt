how is working of multiple inheritance in cpp?????
reflection in java??
dynamic binding in java in depth

-java not support multiple implementation inheritance. java support muliple interface inheritance
-abstract class and interfaces are non-activable ( we cannot create a obj & instance of this class)
-Function interface=> the interface having only having one method .

/*
public interface Profitable {
	void addInterest(int period);
}
--we(can but) cannot write fields(variable)(instance field) in interfaces, if we write it take it as a public , static and final(class fields) .

//public interface Profitable {
	int rate=0.9 //its wrong.^
	void addInterest(int period);
//}
